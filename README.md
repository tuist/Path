# Path

Apple discontinued the maintenance of [swift-tools-support-core](https://github.com/apple/swift-tools-support-core),
which included useful `RelativePath` and `AbsolutePath` abstractions to model file paths.
This repository is a fork of the last version of `swift-tools-support-core` that included these abstractions.
